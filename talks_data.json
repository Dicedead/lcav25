    "talk_title": "Understanding the Universality Phenomenon in High-Dimensional Estimation and Learning: Some Recent Progress",
    "talk_description": "Universality is a fascinating high-dimensional phenomenon. It points to the existence of universal laws that govern the macroscopic behavior of wide classes of large and complex systems, despite their differences in microscopic details. In this talk, I will present some recent progress in rigorously understanding and exploiting the universality phenomenon in the context of statistical estimation and learning on high-dimensional data. Examples include spectral methods for high-dimensional projection pursuit, statistical learning based on kernel and random feature models, approximate message passing algorithms, structured random dimension reduction maps for efficient sketching, and regularized linear regression on highly structured, strongly correlated, and even (nearly) deterministic design matrices. Together, they demonstrate the robustness and wide applicability of the universality phenomenon.",

    "talk_title": "A particle beam microscope is not a digital camera",
    "talk_description": "A particle beam microscope uses a focused beam of ions or electrons to cause the emission of secondary electrons (SEs) from a sample. A micrograph is formed from the SEs detected during the dwell time of the beam at each raster scan location. It seems innocuous to analogize the microscope with an ordinary digital camera, but with serialized pixel-by-pixel data collection. This is valid in some ways, but it precludes maximum information extraction. Time resolution within each pixel dwell time enables significant improvements without changes to the basic microscope hardware. Several fun and easy theoretical results will be shared, along with progress on the quest to fully demonstrate the merit of this idea.",

    "talk_title": "From super-resolution to occlusion inpainting - a story of filling missing pixels",
    "talk_description": "This talk will cover several methods to estimate missing pixel information. First, I will discuss super-resolution imaging, where the goal is to interpolate intermediate pixels to generate a higher resolution image. Next, we shift our attention to 3D, adding depth information to images. That enables us to create novel views from a different perspective, allowing a viewer to perceive images in 3D. However, novel view synthesis brings new pixels to be filled in: occlusion areas. Occlusion inpainting is the technique to fill in areas of pixels that were invisible from the original point of view. This results in more naturally perceived 3D images.",

    "talk_title": "Delicious problems, serious gadgets",
    "talk_description": "When doing research in education, it takes a few months to identify an interesting problem, one that can be tackled with local interventions. I will present 10 problems and the digital solutions we built, one problem and one solution per minute (dual eye tracking, learning analytics, interactive furniture, tangible interfaces, swarm robotic,  AR/VR). Some of these solutions may appear as gadgets but they have been tested in school contexts through formal experiments. While many tools can be described as innovative, the starting point has not been a quest for innovation. However, when teachers spontaneously state « I did not know one could do that », it means the project will have impact beyond the product and the publications.",

    "talk_description": "For decades, representing a physical artwork on a screen simply came down to showing its photograph which greatly reduces its true materiality and visual richness. In 2012, the eFacsimile research project tackled the problem of how to capture and represent faithfully on digital screens the complicated nature of a physical work of art. This then led to the creation of ARTMYN, a technology company that provides unique solutions for digitizing visual artworks. From custom imaging hardware to advanced imaging algorithms and latest web visualization applications, ARTMYN brings the most advanced digital experience to the art world.",
